# Part 1: Failure

# `undefined`

???

Let's start with the bottom.

Haskell expressions don't always successfully evaluate.
There are two mechanisms for runtime errors: functions are
either **partial** or they **throw exceptions**.

`undefined` is the simplest partial function. It always typechecks,
and blows up whenever it is evaluated.

a.k.a. *bottom*, the root of all runtime errors

```haskell
undefined :: forall a. a
```

--

```sh
Î»> length undefined
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/base/GHC/Err.hs:79:14 in base:GHC.Err
  undefined, called at <interactive>:2:8 in interactive:Ghci1
```

--

```haskell
important :: Thing -> Other Thing
important thing =
  fmap undefined (unpack thing)
```

---

# `error`

---

# `read`

---

# Record accessors
